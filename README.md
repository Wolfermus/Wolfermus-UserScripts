# Wolfermus-UserScripts
Website userscripts that are designed to just be able to copy&amp;paste into your console or use a userscript manager and work.

This GitHub is currently in WIP rapid changes are happening.

All `.user.js` you can copy&paste into your console of use a userscript manager except for `Main.user.js` which requires a userscript manager to work.
Normal `.js` files are not designed to be executed in the console.
