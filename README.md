# Wolfermus-UserScripts
Website userscripts that are designed to be used by a userscript manager to work.

The reason why a userscript manager is required is because of CSP and `fetch` being disabled on websites like Youtube, if you have a way to `fetch` in the console on Youtube please let me know.
